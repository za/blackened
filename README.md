A simple repo to demonstrate how we can run black before committing the changes.

```
(.venv) ‚ûú  blackened git:(main) ‚úó gc
[WARNING] The 'rev' field of repo 'https://github.com/psf/black' appears to be a mutable reference (moving tag / branch).  Mutable references are never updated after first install and are not supported.  See https://pre-commit.com/#using-the-latest-version-for-a-repository for more details.  Hint: `pre-commit autoupdate` often fixes this.
